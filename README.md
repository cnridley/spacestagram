# Spacestagram 

A project made for the Shopfy intern Challenge. 

This web page has been developed using Flask, JavaScript and I used MongoDB as a database so that I could have a log in/register user functionality. 

When a user logs in data is fetched from the NASA APOD API and displayed to the user in Bootstrap cards, users then have the ability to change the date range for the images. 

An account has been made for testing purposes - but please feel free to create a new user!
